### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, i use the css grid very nicely, i think this is an appropriate approach to lay out these testimonial cards. i wanna do some things in one step, or that i won't have to do some things again and again for some elements, i tried so hard to set html like that, but it somehow made it worse, and i end up spending more time then i would if i've just made seperate code for each element.

### Continued development

For now i need to start with frontend but i'm going to continue backend devoloping and then if everything goes correctly then will countinue either in robotics coding and developement or in gaming industry.
